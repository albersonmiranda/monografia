	abstract = {Educar é, antes de tudo, organizar a experiência dos indivíduos na vida cotidiana, desenvolver-lhes a personalidade e garantir-lhes a sobrevivência. As ações empreendidas com a finalidade de educar estão diretamente relacionadas às normas sociais vigentes e aos valores compartilhados pelos indivíduos, no contexto de determinadas sociedade, cultura e tempo histórico. Se as regras do mundo social já estão prontas quando nascemos, a vida que vivemos na relação com os outros nos convida a mudá-las, e nós as mudamos, mesmo que não percebamos ou que apenas as gerações seguintes sintam os efeitos de nossa intervenção.A sociologia é uma ciência que surge e se desenvolve com o advento do capitalismo. Por causa dessa marca de nascimento, a reflexão sociológica, que aparece na sistematização intelectual de seus fundadores mais importantes como Émile Durkheim, Karl Marx ou Max Weber, tem como ponto de partida o interesse em compreender as maravilhas e as atrocidades deste novo mundo que se abriu com o desenvolvimento da grande indústria moderna e da sociedade dividida em classes.Para a sociologia, não há pedagogia neutra: todas são construídas e utilizadas em meio a valores e normas, com o objetivo de conservar o status quo ou de subvertê-lo. Olhar a educação do ponto de vista da sociologia é compreender que se por um lado as pedagogias são o fundamento das práticas educacionais, por outro as crenças, os valores e as normas sociais são os fundamentos da pedagogia. Este livro apresenta a sociologia da educação como a disciplina acadêmica que se preocupa em reconstruir as relações, que existem na prática cotidiana, entre as ações que objetivam educar e as estruturas da vida social, quer dizer, a economia, a cultura, as normas jurídicas, as concepções de mundo, os conflitos políticos.},

	abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression \& path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.},

	doi = {10.4102/sajce.v11i1.899},
	abstract = {Background: Mathematics education is a significant issue in the South African context. Learners’ achievement levels are markedly low as suggested by both national and international studies. The teaching and learning of fractions in particular have been identified as challenging.

Aim: The aim of this article is to share some of the outcomes derived from a series of lessons in which aspects of music (note values) were integrated into the teaching of fractions in primary school.

Setting: The study was conducted in a Grade 5 class in an independent school in the Eastern Cape, with readily available resources at hand.

Methods: The broader study was an action research case study. It employed qualitative methods of data collection, based on cycles of critical reflection and adjustment, including feedback from learners and critical peers.

Results: Findings highlighted the value of integrating music and mathematics as a teaching and learning strategy. Learning support materials and activities that promoted curriculum integration were designed. The discussion highlights benefits of these integrated lessons.

Conclusion: We conclude by suggesting that teachers explore synergistic opportunities across mathematics and music as subjects. In particular, we suggest curriculum integration to support the teaching of fractions in the primary grades of schooling. Our hope is that this article will encourage teachers to develop their own integrated strategies for enriching their teaching of mathematics.},

This evaluation of research helps to support the evidence base by examining the quality of studies published between 1995 and 2011 investigating the use of arts integration with disadvantaged student populations, including economically disadvantaged students, English language learners, and students with disabilities. Four hundred fifty-three studies were explored, resulting in the inclusion of forty-four studies in this analysis. Studies were categorized as the following: single art integration, multi-arts integration, effects of arts integration on students with disabilities, or effects of arts integration on school climate. Studies were evaluated for their research design, implementation, and effects, and results depicted positive effects and potentially positive effects. Policy implications and suggestions for future research using the author's proposed theoretical framework are also discussed.},

Basically, we compare earnings before the graduate degree to earnings after it. Using National Science Foundation data, we find large differences across graduate fields in earnings effects. The returns often depend on the undergraduate major. The contribution of occupational upgrading to the earnings gain varies across degrees.

We find substantial variation across degrees, and evidence that OLS overestimates the returns to degrees with the highest average earnings and underestimates the returns to degrees with the lowest average earnings. Second, we decompose the impacts on earnings into effects on wage rates and effects on hours. For most degrees, the earnings gains come from increased wage rates, though hours play an important role in some degrees, such as medicine, especially for women. Third, we estimate the net present value and internal rate of return for each degree, which account for the time and monetary costs of degrees. Finally, we provide descriptive evidence that satisfaction gains are large for some degrees with smaller economic returns, such as education and humanities degrees, especially for men.},

The decline in other measures of earnings inequality was even larger, with the 90-10 percentile ratio falling by almost 40 percent. Applying micro-econometric decomposition techniques, this study parses out the proximate determinants of this substantial reduction in earnings inequality. Although a falling education premium did play a role, in line with received wisdom, this study finds that a reduction in the returns to labor market experience was a much more important factor driving lower wage disparities. It accounted for 53 percent of the observed decline in the Gini index during the period. Reductions in horizontal inequalities – the gender, race, regional and urban-rural wage gaps, conditional on human capital and institutional variables – also contributed. Two main factors operated against the decline: a greater disparity in wage premia to different sectors of economic activity, and the “paradox of progress”: the mechanical inequality-increasing effect of a more educated labor force when returns to education are convex.},

We find substantial differences in expected real wages and expected real wage growth between majors and that both characteristics of life cycle earnings influence major choice. Our parametric models show a strong correlation between salary trends and major choice, whereas semiparametric models yield less reliable results. We interpret our results as being consistent with agents being rational and as a validation for our estimation strategy based on counterfactual imputation.},

In April, 192 countries had closed all schools and universities, affecting more than 90 percent of the world’s learners: over 1.5 billion children and young people. Closures are expected to reduce schooling and lead to future losses in earnings. Starting from the assumption that every additional year of schooling translates to 8 percent in future earnings, this paper estimates and confirms the loss in marginal future earnings on the basis of a four-month shutdown. We also estimated the losses by level of education. The findings show that the school closures reduce future earnings. It is also likely that students from low-income countries will be affected most, where the earning losses will be devastating. These estimates are conservative, assuming closures end after four months, with schools re-opening in the new academic year, and that school quality will not suffer.},

	abstract = {This article reviews the role of education in promoting economic growth, with a particular focus on the role of knowledge capital, or the aggregate skills of a country. It concludes that there is strong evidence that the cognitive skills of the population – rather than mere school attainment – are powerfully related to long-run economic growth. The relationship between knowledge capital and growth proves extremely robust in empirical applications. The effect of skills is complementary to the quality of economic institutions. Growth simulations reveal that the long-run rewards to educational quality are large but also require patience.},

For developed countries, average annual returns to education tend to be in the neighborhood of 10\%, ranging from 5\% to 15\%, with considerable variation across different individuals and contexts. Returns are increasing over time and tend to be higher for: females as opposed to males; degree or credential holders as opposed to dropouts; general academic streams compared to technical vocational streams; and professional fields like engineering, medicine, business and sciences as opposed to social sciences and humanities and especially fields like fine arts. Social returns or externalities to third-parties are likely substantial, and estimated be in the neighborhood of the private returns of around 10\%, effectively doubling the returns.},
